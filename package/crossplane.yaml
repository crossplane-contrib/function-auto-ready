    meta.crossplane.io/description: A composition function that automatically detects when resources are ready, with resource-specific health checks for standard Kubernetes resources
    meta.crossplane.io/readme: |
      This composition function automatically detects composed resources that
      are ready. It implements resource-specific health checks for standard
      Kubernetes resources (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Service, Ingress,
      Secret, ConfigMap) and falls back to Ready condition checks for Crossplane
      managed resources. Crossplane considers a composite resource (XR) to be ready
      when all of its desired composed resources are ready. See the
      [README](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/function-auto-ready)
      for examples and documentation.
